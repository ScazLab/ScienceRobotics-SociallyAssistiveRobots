So people build things like bicycles and skateboards so you can move further and faster, but still powered by your feet! Some people even do cool tricks!"

		},
		{
			"command": "The first experiment is to compare the gravity on Earth to the gravity on Bebop. Gravity is the force that causes things to fall. It is caused by the amount of mass an object has. The bigger something is, the more gravity it has."
		},
		{
			"command": "Everything with mass has gravity, even you and me! Compared to a planet weâ€™re both pretty small, so we donâ€™t have a lot of gravity."
		},

		},

		},
		{
			"command": "If you go somewhere high up, like a tall building or a mountain, the air pressure decreases."

			"command": "On Earth, if you dig through the crust, you reach the mantle, which is a vast ocean of molten rock, this is similar to the magma that comes out of a volcano!"
		},

		},
		{
			"command": "Itâ€™s good that Beebop has a lot of silicon, most of the living creatures there are made of it!"
		},
		{
			"command": "Most of the living things on Earth are made of carbon, but since silicon is what makes computer chips work, a planet full of robots needs lots of it!"
		},
		{

		},

		},
		{
			"screen": "daily_stories/24.5-blue_giant.png",
			"command": "The Brightcircle is a blue giant, the older version of the Earthâ€™s sun. Because itâ€™s less hot, Bebop is a lot closer to it than Earth is to its sun. So the sun on Bebop seems bigger than the sun on Earth."
