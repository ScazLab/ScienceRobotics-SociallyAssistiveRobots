So people build things like bicycles and skateboards so you can move further and faster, but still powered by your feet! Some people even do cool tricks!"
		},

		},
		{
			"command": "The first experiment is to compare the gravity on Earth to the gravity on Bebop. Gravity is the force that causes things to fall. It is caused by the amount of mass an object has. The bigger something is, the more gravity it has."
		},
		{
			"command": "Everything with mass has gravity, even you and me! Compared to a planet we’re both pretty small, so we don’t have a lot of gravity."
		},

			"command": "My gravity sensor uses a small marble and a clock. It measures the time it takes the marble to fall two inches, then calculates the strength of the gravity here on Earth."
		},

		},

			"command": "If you go somewhere high up, like a tall building or a mountain, the air pressure decreases."

		},
		{
			"command": "It’s good that Beebop has a lot of silicon, most of the living creatures there are made of it!"
		},
		{
			"command": "Most of the living things on Earth are made of carbon, but since silicon is what makes computer chips work, a planet full of robots needs lots of it!"
		},

		},

		},

		},
		{
			"screen": "daily_stories/24.5-blue_giant.png",
